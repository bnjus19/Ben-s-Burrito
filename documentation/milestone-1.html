    current online ordering technologies on the market, especially when it comes to ordering online from restaurants for pickup or
    delivery. My typical customer will also like their food made to order with fresh ingredients, and since we'll be using cage-free
    raised chickens without being fed antibiotics, they may have a stronger desire to order clean chicken meat. Our customer We'll also
    have freshly hydroponically lettuce and tomatoes, and we'll make our tortillas from scratch. Our customer may also be attracted to our
    fast eco-conscious electric vehicle delivery so we help cut emissions to the environment while delivering our food. We will be open
    at very early hours when most restaurants aren't open so the early birds customers can order from us. Last but not least, our
    prices will be very reasonable, we'll have the best value in town for a good sized freshly made breakfast burrito.</p>
