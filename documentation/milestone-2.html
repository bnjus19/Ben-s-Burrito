<p>Content Strategy</p>
<p>The purpose of my content strategy is show the user at the header bar, which is what the user
sees immediately, what my restaurant ben's burrito is about and shows some ways to order such as grubhub, ubereats,
and doordash. The about me section will tell the user about the restaurant, our history, our mission, how we
started. The other parts of the homepage talk about our cage free raised chickens, fresh grown vegetables, and
all our menu items and current food deals. The mobile site, will do what the desktop site does except the display the
information better suited for the mobile display.</p>
