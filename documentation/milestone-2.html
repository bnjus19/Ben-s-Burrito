<p>Content Strategy</p>
The purpose of my content strategy is show the user at the header bar, which is what the user
sees immediately, what they are capable of doing on the site. Such as create an online
user account, look at the Menu, sign up for our rewards, start a pickup or a delivery order.
On the front page is a comment box where the users can type in comments about their experiences
at the restaurant.
